## Redux Record Store
An online record shop, with shopping cart functionality built with React and Redux.

### To-Do:
 * implement filtering functionality on the record store page (album format, album artist, genre, year, etc).
 * develop an API and Admin interface to add, edit, and delete available Records from a database (replacing the hard coded constants that are currently populating the record store).
 * implement a better solution for resizing album images.
